- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GhostOcter, also known as ThÃ©o MoliniÃ©.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all sorts of informatic, physics and maths.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning, being very curious by nature.
- Here you can find some of my project : of course they aren't perfect, but you know it's by trying and making errors that you learn.
